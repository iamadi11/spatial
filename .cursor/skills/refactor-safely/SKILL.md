# Refactor Safely

Use the knowledge graph to plan and execute refactoring with confidence.

## Steps

1. Use `refactor_tool` with mode="suggest" for community-driven refactoring suggestions.
2. Use `refactor_tool` with mode="dead_code" to find unreferenced code.
3. For renames, use `refactor_tool` with mode="rename" to preview all affected locations.
4. Use `apply_refactor_tool` with the refactor_id to apply renames (if available in your MCP server).
5. After changes, run `detect_changes` to verify the refactoring impact.

## Safety Checks

- Always preview before applying (rename mode gives you an edit list).
- Check `get_impact_radius` before major refactors.
- Use `get_affected_flows` to ensure no critical paths are broken.
- Run `find_large_functions` if your graph exposes it to identify decomposition targets.
